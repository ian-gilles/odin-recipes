        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pottage is simply a thick vegetable stew that optionally contains
            grains or meat. It is one of those unique meals that was served
            equally to peasants, knights, and kings depending on the quality
            of ingredients and presentation. As suggested by the name, pottage
            is traditionally cooked and served all within one pot. This recipe
            would likely have been served to low nobility or peasantry on a
            special occassion due to containing bacon.

            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 8 oz. cans of butter beans or other white beans,
                drained and rinsed
            </li>
            <li>2 t whole-grain or stone-ground mustard</li>
            <li>600 ml vegetable broth</li>
            <li>200 ml water</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a knife or scissors, cut bacon into bite-size
                pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Cut leek in half length-wise. Fan the separate segments
                under cool water to wash away any remaining alluvium.
                Slice into ~0.5cm sections.
            </li>
            <li>Taking a knife, slice the celery concave up along the
                start of the curves so that three equal size strips remain.
                Roughly chop into small pieces.
            </li>
            <li>Add the bacon to a large, pre-heated pot and let cook for
                about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add your veggies and thyme, but not your garlic. Cook over low
                for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While this cooks, mince your garlic. When about 30 seconds remain,
                add your garlic and cook until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, then simmer with
                lid for about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>At this point, begin mashing or blending with an immersion blender
                the pottage.
            </li>
            <li>Take off heat and serve with a dark, crusty bread or some other carb.</li>
        </ol>
